If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, I would have characterize their audio aura by:
-> Weighting the songs based on playcount (favorite ones get high weightage).
-> How recently played (recent ones gets high weightage).
-> Grouping the songs with similar audio features (energy, tempo, valence).
-> Taking the median value within each group (to get the most common favorite type of songs without letting the extremes affect as in average).
-> Selecting the songs from the most dominant group to form the listener aura.

While this method is better then a simple average, but not the best because:
-> It ignores the context of listening and timing that when certain types of songs are played(like in gyms, while driving, studying).
-> If the listener is trying a new song then just this one random song will affect the aura.
-> Large difference in (features of) songs will cause grouping (them on same features) give poor results.
-> It doesn't preview lyrics (a slow sad song and slow happy song is not differentiated which is again important).
-> There is no seasonal or timely patterns recognization, what if the users mood changes by time then the recently ones get more weightage.

Better ways of calculating the aura would be:
-> to give different importance to each songs according to the context of listening like (in gym, while driving, studying).
-> Ignore random just one or two songs from the list.
-> First grouping the songs according to genres then according to features this would get list of songs which we will be then easy to further group.
-> There should be Lyrics sentiment analysis which will get the sense of lyrics.
-> Patterns recognization to recognize regular and popular listening patterns like according to season and time.
