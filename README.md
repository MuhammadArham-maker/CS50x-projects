# CS50x Projects by Muhammad Arham

This repository contains my solutions and projects from Harvard University's CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science.

I have completed problem sets and projects in C and Python, covering topics such as memory, algorithms, cryptography, data structures, and more.

## ‚úÖ Completed Projects

### Week 0 ‚Äì Scratch
- **[My Scratch Project]((https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1201280373/))** ‚Äì A fun visual program made with MIT Scratch. A "MONSTER SHOOTING GAME".

### Week 1 ‚Äì C
- **Hello** ‚Äì Simple "Hello, world" program.
- **Mario (less/more)** ‚Äì Prints pyramid patterns using loops.
- **Cash** ‚Äì Greedy algorithm to give change using coins.
- **Credit** ‚Äì Validates credit card numbers using Luhn‚Äôs Algorithm.

### Week 2 ‚Äì Arrays
- **Readability** ‚Äì Calculates grade level of a text.
- **Caesar** ‚Äì Implements Caesar cipher encryption.
- **Substitution** ‚Äì Substitution cipher with key.
- **Scrabble** ‚Äì Calculates word scores like the game Scrabble by assigning points to letters.

### Week 3 ‚Äì Algorithms
- **Plurality** ‚Äì Voting program using arrays.
- **Tideman** ‚Äì Ranked choice voting using sorting & graph logic.
- **Runoff** ‚Äì Simulates a runoff election with vote redistribution logic.
- **Sort (answers.txt)** ‚Äì Theoretical answers explaining sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.

### Week 4 ‚Äì Memory
- **Filter (less)** ‚Äì Applies image filters (grayscale, sepia, blur, edges) using loop and pixel manipulation.
- **Filter (more)** ‚Äì Adds blur and edge detection to images using algorithms like box blur and Sobel filter.
- **Recover** ‚Äì Recovers deleted JPEGs from a forensic image.
- **Volume** ‚Äì Modifies the volume of an audio file by scaling sample amplitudes.

### Week 5 ‚Äì Data Structures
- **Inheritance** ‚Äì Simulates genetic inheritance of blood types using recursion and dynamic memory in C.
- **Speller** ‚Äì A spell checker using a hash table to find misspelled words from a dictionary.  
  Implemented `dictionary.c` and `dictionary.h` for loading, checking, and unloading words efficiently.

### Week 6 - Python
- **Hello** - Basic Python program to print "hello, world!".
- **Mario (Less)** - Prints a left-aligned pyramid using loops.
- **Mario (More)** - Prints a right-aligned pyramid with two sides.
- **Cash** - Implements a greedy algorithm to calculate the minimum number of coins for change.
- **Credit** - Uses Luhn‚Äôs Algorithm to validate credit card numbers.
- **Readability** - Calculates the grade level of a text using the Coleman-Liau index.
- **DNA** - Identifies a person based on their DNA sequence by matching Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) in a database.

### Week 7 - SQL
- **Songs** - Query a music database to extract information about artists, songs, and genres.
- **Movies** - Query a database of movies to answer questions about actors, ratings, and relationships.
- **Fiftyville** - Solve a mystery by writing SQL queries to search through tables of people, flights, phone calls, and more.

### Week 8 - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Trivia** - A web-based trivia game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
             - Features multiple-choice and free-response questions with interactive feedback.
- **Homepage**- A simple personal website built using HTML and CSS, with multiple pages (about, achievements, contact, logo).

### Week 9 ‚Äì Flask / Web Programming
- **Birthday** ‚Äì A web app to manage and track birthdays. Built with Flask, Python, and SQL.
- **Finance** ‚Äì A stock trading web app where users can register, log in, buy/sell stocks, and view their portfolio. Built with Flask, SQL, and APIs.
