# CS50x Projects by Muhammad Arham

This repository contains my solutions and projects from Harvard University's CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science.

I have completed problem sets and projects in C and Python, covering topics such as memory, algorithms, cryptography, data structures, and more.

## ✅ Completed Projects

### Week 0 – Scratch
- **[My Scratch Project]((https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1201280373/))** – A fun visual program made with MIT Scratch. A "MONSTER SHOOTING GAME".

### Week 1 – C
- **Hello** – Simple "Hello, world" program.
- **Mario (less/more)** – Prints pyramid patterns using loops.
- **Cash** – Greedy algorithm to give change using coins.
- **Credit** – Validates credit card numbers using Luhn’s Algorithm.

### Week 2 – Arrays
- **Readability** – Calculates grade level of a text.
- **Caesar** – Implements Caesar cipher encryption.
- **Substitution** – Substitution cipher with key.
- **Scrabble** – Calculates word scores like the game Scrabble by assigning points to letters.

### Week 3 – Algorithms
- **Plurality** – Voting program using arrays.
- **Tideman** – Ranked choice voting using sorting & graph logic.
- **Runoff** – Simulates a runoff election with vote redistribution logic.
- **Sort (answers.txt)** – Theoretical answers explaining sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.

### Week 4 – Memory
- **Filter (less)** – Applies image filters (grayscale, sepia, blur, edges) using loop and pixel manipulation.
- **Filter (more)** – Adds blur and edge detection to images using algorithms like box blur and Sobel filter.
- **Recover** – Recovers deleted JPEGs from a forensic image.
- **Volume** – Modifies the volume of an audio file by scaling sample amplitudes.

### Week 5 – Data Structures
- **Inheritance** – Simulates genetic inheritance of blood types using recursion and dynamic memory in C.

### 🚧 More coming soon...
Stay tuned! I’ll be updating this repository with the remaining CS50x projects including web development, Python, Flask, and my final project (*a surprise!!*).


## 🌐 About Me

I'm a student passionate about computer science, artificial intelligence, and software development. These projects are part of my learning journey to build a strong foundation and i enjoy doing them.
